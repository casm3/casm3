### Hello 👋, I'm *Carlos*, 34 years old, from Garanhuns, a city in the countryside of Pernambuco. I have been a Researcher, Programmer, and Professor for over 15 years. I recently concluded my postdoctoral research at the [Federal University of Piauí.](https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/programa/apresentacao.jsf?lc=pt_BR&id=615)

----------------------------
### About me:
I hold a PhD (2017–2021) and a Master's degree (2014–2016) in Computer Science from the Center for Informatics at the Federal University of Pernambuco ([CIn-UFPE](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/)). I also have a specialization in Cloud Computing (2021) from the Polytechnic School of the University of Pernambuco ([POLI-UPE](https://poli.br/)) and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (2009–2013) from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco ([UFRPE](https://www.ufrpe.br/)).

I recently completed a postdoctoral position in the Graduate Program in Computer Science at the Federal University of Piauí ([PPGCC-UFPI](https://ufpi.br/)), where I conducted research on the modeling and performance evaluation of platforms based on **Blockchain** technology.

Previously, I worked as a web development instructor (2021–2024) at the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) programming school, teaching the Computer Science with Python module and the elective on Backend Development with Java, where I was responsible for creating curricula, developing automated projects, and producing written and video content.

I was also a Section Leader (2021) in the Code in Place program at [Stanford University](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), a professor of Information Security (2021) at [Uni São Miguel](https://www.unisaomiguel.edu.br), and taught Computer Networks and General Systems Theory (2018–2019) at [Faculdade Alpha](https://faculdade.alpha.edu.br/).

Additionally, I was a research assistant in a project between the Center for Informatics at UFPE and Motorola (2015–2017), focusing on the development of applications for data synchronization services between mobile devices and cloud platforms.
